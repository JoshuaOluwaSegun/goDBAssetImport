  - AssetTypes > SoftwareInventory > AssetIDColumn
  - AssetTypes > SoftwareInventory > AppIDColumn

## 3.1.2 (July 22nd, 2022)

Fixes:

- Fixed h_attrib_8 and h_attrib_1 for the HornbillUserIDColumn, please use "h_attrib8" and "h_attrib1" instead (respectively).

## 3.0.2 (June 20th, 2022)

Features:

- Added '''InPolicy''' key per Asset type. The options are ''yes'' and `__clear__` and anything else (including omission). "yes" will ensure the asset will be set In Policy (used on Create, Update and Both), `__clear__` is only used if the determined action is "Update" - please note that the timeline will be irrecoverably removed.
- Date Conversion template filters added: "date_conversion" and "date_conversion_clear". The latter will CLEAR the field if the transformation doesn't work. to be used: {{ .FieldName | date_conversion "02/01/2006 15:04:05" }} - provide the input format based on the following reference time of "Jan 1st 2006 4 minutes and 5 seconds past 3pm." - the example shown will convert the regular UK/European date time format to the format useable in the Hornbill datetime field. Please note that IF your formatting is already in the Hornbill date time format ("2006-01-02 15:04:05"), you don't need to convert anything.

- Added auto-update of utility for releases with same major version

Fixed:

- Owned By, Used By and Last Updated By URNs not correctly set when HornbillUserIDColumn property is set to something other than h_user_id
- Better handled incorrect instance ID, outputs a message and ends rather than panicking

## 2.4.0 (September 9th, 2021)

Changes:

- Removed SupplierManagerIntegration property from configuration, as this is catered for by DBContractColumn and DBSupplierColumn options in the AssetIdentifier object

## 2.2.0 (August 5th, 2021)

Change:

- Added configuration validation to ensure v2.x compatible mappings are used

## 2.1.1 (August 4th, 2021)

- Simplified bool const comparisons

## 1.16.1 (July 6th, 2021)

## 1.15.0 (May 14th, 2021)

Features:
- Departments are now mapped (if h_department_name is set - h_department_id will be set behind the scenes) - this now matches the behaviour of organisations (the h_company_name field)
- Ability to specific the Hornbill User ID column for matching users (HornbillUserIDColumn; options: h_user_id (default), h_employee_id, h_email, h_name, h_attrib_1 & h_login_id) - please note that last logged on, owned by and used by will use the same field - i.e. one can NOT specify which column to match to individually.

Changes:
- Front-loading of groups (organisations & departments) - to prevent search for each asset
- Front-loading of Sites - to prevent search for each asset
- If no Asset ID is specified the record will be skipped - instead of activating a search for the asset (to check whether the asset has already been created)

Fixes:
- Possible fix whereby h_asset_urn was not populated correctly
- Optimisation added such that front-loading is not happening if the associated fields are not actually configured.
